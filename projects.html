    <p>Two projects i've done</p>
    <p>In 2017 I got my blackbelt in Taekwondo. I practiced at Han Martial Arts Studio in Montclair, CA. I practiced from 2nd grade to 8th grade. I enjoyed taking Taekwondo because it allowed me to feel empowered and it is a skill I will carry for my entire life. Additionally, there was a large community at the studio and I made lots of friends.</p>
     <img src = "cello.png">
     <p>Another project I've done is my orchestra concert. I recently completed my Spring concert. We played six songs including songs from the movie Ratatouille and a piece written by a student in our class. I play cello. I've been playing since 5th grade. At the end of the concert, we acknowledged the graduating seniors who have been in our class from the very beginning. </p>
